# Battleship

<h2>CS 32 <b>Main</b> Project</h2>
<p> The purpose of this project was to utilize class structure, recursion, and pointer objects to create a fully-functioning game of <em>Battleship</em>. This project scored a 90% on test cases derived by the professor but in independent testing was fun nonetheless. </p>

<h6>Note</h6>
<p> Though there are mutlple CS32 projects which developed my skills in C++ across CS31/CS32 the <em>Battleship</em> project is the one I found myself most prideful in. For that reason it is my <em>Magnum Opus</em> of the 30 series. </p>
